/*
  Section 1: Reference: Quick Guide
  
  Variables and Data Types
  - Syntax: let myVariable = 'Hello'; or const myOtherVariable = 10;
  - Use Cases: Store data for later use. Use const for values that won't change, and let for values that might.
  - Common Types: string (text), number (numeric values), boolean (true or false).
  
  Operators
  - Syntax: a + b, a === b, a > b
  - Use Cases: Perform operations on values.
  - Examples: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), === (strict equality), > (greater than), < (less than), % (modulus), ++ (increment), -- (decrement).
  
  Functions
  - Syntax:
    function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2) {
      // code to be executed
      return result;
    }
  - Use Cases: Group reusable code. A function can take inputs (parameters) and give back an output (return value).

  Conditionals
  - Syntax:
    if (condition) {
      // code to run if true
    } else if (anotherCondition) {
      // code to run if anotherCondition is true
    } else {
      // code to run if all conditions are false
    }
  - Use Cases: Execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false.

 Quick Guide to Operators
  Arithmetic: + (Add), - (Subtract), * (Multiply), / (Divide), % (Remainder), ++ (Add 1), -- (Subtract 1)
  Assignment: = (Assign value), += (Add and assign), -= (Subtract and assign)
  Comparison: == (Equal value), === (Equal value & type), != (Unequal value), !== (Unequal value & type), > (Greater than), < (Less than), >= (Greater than or equal to), <= (Less than or equal to)
  Logical: && (AND - both true), || (OR - at least one true), ! (NOT - reverse boolean)
*/

/*
  Challenge 2: Operators
  
  1.  Create two number variables, `x` and `y`, with values 10 and 5.
  2.  Create a variable `sum` that holds the result of adding `x` and `y`.
  3.  Create a variable `difference` that holds the result of subtracting `y` from `x`.
  4.  Create a variable `product` that holds the result of multiplying `x` and `y`.
  5.  Create a variable `quotient` that holds the result of dividing `x` by `y`.
  6.  Create a boolean variable `isStrictlyEqual` that checks if `x` is strictly equal to the number 10.
  7.  Create a boolean variable `isNotEqual` that checks if `x` is not strictly equal to the string "10".
  8.  Create a boolean variable `isGreaterThan` that checks if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.
  9.  Create a boolean variable `isLessThan` that checks if `y` is less than `x`.
  10. Create a variable `remainder` that holds the remainder of `x` divided by 3.
  11. Create a boolean variable `isEven` that checks if `x` is an even number using the modulus operator.
  12. Create a variable `power` that holds the result of `y` raised to the power of 2. (Hint: Use the `**` operator or `Math.pow()`).
  13. Create a boolean variable `isTrue` that checks if `x` is greater than 8 and `y` is less than 6.
  14. Create a boolean variable `isFalse` that checks if `x` is equal to 12 or `y` is equal to 2.
  15. Create a variable `negate` that holds the result of negating a boolean value (e.g., `!true` is `false`).
  16. Using the `x` and `y` variables from above, reassign the value of `x` to be the original value of `x` minus `y`.
  17. Declare a variable `counter` and set it to 0. Then, using an operator, increase its value by 1.
  18. Declare a variable `price` and set it to 50. Use an operator to increase its value by 20.
  19. Declare a variable `isActive` and set it to true. Use a logical operator to change its value to false.
  20. Declare a variable `level` and set it to 10. Use an operator to increase its value by 5 and then reassign `level` to this new value.
