  Practice Worksheet: JavaScript While Loops

/*
  Syntax:
    initialization;
    while (condition) {
      // code to be executed
      final-expression;
    }

  Purpose:
    A while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's often used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
    - initialization: Used to declare a counter or starting variable before the loop.
    - condition: Evaluated before each loop iteration. If the condition is true, the loop continues. If it's false, the loop terminates.
    - final-expression: Code that changes the variable used in the condition, preventing an infinite loop. This is usually an increment or decrement.

const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
const passwords = ["abc", "12345", "password123"];

*/

/*
  1. Countdown
  Task: Use a while loop to count down from 5 to 1, and print each number to the console.
*/


/*
  2. Sum of Array Elements
  Task: Use a while loop to calculate the sum of all elements in the `numbers` array. Print the final sum.
*/


/*
  3. Find the Password
  Task: Use a while loop to iterate through the `passwords` array. If you find the password "password123", print "Access Granted!" and stop the loop.
  
  New Concept: The `break` statement
  The `break` statement can be used inside a loop to immediately exit the loop.

/*
  4. User Input Simulation
  Task: Use a while loop to simulate a user login attempt. Start with a variable `attempt` set to 0. Inside the loop, increment `attempt` and print a message like "Attempt #[number]". The loop should continue as long as `attempt` is less than 3.
*/


/*
  5. Double the Number
  Task: Start with a variable `x = 1`. Use a while loop to repeatedly double `x` as long as `x` is less than 100. Print the value of `x` in each iteration.
*/


/*
  6. Guessing Game
  Task: This challenge requires a bit more thought. Use a while loop to create a simple guessing game.
  1. Set a variable `secretNumber` to 7.
  2. Set a variable `guess` to some number (e.g., 0).
  3. The loop should continue as long as `guess` is not equal to `secretNumber`.
  4. Inside the loop, print "Incorrect guess."
  5. **Crucially**, you must find a way to make the loop terminate. Think about how you would change the `guess` variable to eventually match the `secretNumber` to stop the loop. (You can hardcode a new value for `guess` inside the loop for now, we'll learn about user input later).
